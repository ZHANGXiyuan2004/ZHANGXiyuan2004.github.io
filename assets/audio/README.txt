# Minecraft Audio Assets

To enable sound effects, please add the following audio files to this directory (`assets/audio/`):

1.  `click.mp3` - Standard Minecraft UI click sound.
2.  `pop.mp3` - Minecraft item pickup "pop" sound (for hover effects).
3.  `levelup.mp3` - Minecraft level up or challenge complete sound (for advancements).

You can find these sounds in Minecraft's assets or online resource packs.
Without these files, the site will work but remain silent.
